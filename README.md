### Hi! I'm Donna ðŸ‘‹

## Collegiate Athletic Equipment Manager transitioning into Full-Stack Web Developer


## What I'm currently working on
Building up my portfolio to start job hunting, blogging, mentoring, transitioning collaboration group project from code camp into an open source, and re-working my solo MVP for my job: re-designing the database schema, user workflow, UX/UI design, and components.

## What I'm currently learning
How to make a pixel rpg game, Three.js, build JAM Stack web apps, learn front-end development technologies, local storage in React JS and finally working on building my pwnagotchi. Then on to learning/playing with Kali Linux.

## Pronouns: 

All, I identify as a non-binary queer, and I don't have a preference.

## Fun fact: 

I am a huge fan of the Professor Layton video game series ONLY for Nintendo DS. And I have a soft spot for anyhthing NES, SNES and pixel art related.
